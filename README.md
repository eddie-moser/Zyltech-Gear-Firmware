#Zyltech Gear Firmware  

This firmware is based on the MKS-Robin firmware found here: https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Robin

I created this because it seems that no one understood what was needed to provide the firmware in a usable manner from Zyltech.

Create a bug if you find something wrong.
